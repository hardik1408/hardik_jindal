### 1. **IEEE IROS Humanoid Robot Wrestling Simulation Competition 2023** | Team Humanoid,IITK
- Qualified for 1/8 finals in a competition aimed towards simulating a calibrated model of the NAO robot and implementing
a strategy for wrestling matches against other international teams organised during the IROS 2023 conference.
- Integrated YOLOv5 model for recognizing the position and depth of the opponent robot.
- Used image processing methods for wrestling ring edge detection.
- Worked on accessing positions in respect of global coordinate system by accessing global nodes in WeBots enviornment

### 2. **AI Agent 007: Tooling up for Success** | Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0
- Conducted extensive literature review on open and tool-based language models (LLMs).
- Formulated a generalized learning strategy for language models based on synthesized findings.
- Designed and implemented a question answering model inspired by Llama 2’s structure.
- Tested the model across various datasets using external tools such as ToolLLM, ToolQA, and API-Bank for validation
and performance assessment.

### 3. AI-Based Cost Optimization in Indian Railways Minimizing Carbon Emission | Prof. Gururaj Mirle Vishwanath
- Employed Deep Learning models to forecast Indian Railway Loads spanning 14 states, addressing the data’s dynamic
nature.
- Integrated Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) techniques
alongside Deep Learning methodologies.
- Tackled challenges by incorporating solar and wind forecasting to optimize predictions and bolster accuracy.

### 4. Computer Vision and Drones 101 | Electrical Engineer’s Association
- Implemented PID control in Python for ArUco marker tracking using OpenCV.
- Conducted camera calibration for precise imaging applications.
- Utilized optical flow for motion analysis and performed image stitching for panoramic views.
